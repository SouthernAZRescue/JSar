TO-DO:

RESUME:

- A large deal of code was just done. Thing appear working but need to finish it off by:
    - Wrapping the RegisterLocalUser handler action in a transaction
	- Learn about disposal. Necessary?
    - Add unit tests
	    - Person.PrimaryPhone tests
		- Repository
		- UnitOfWork
	- Add Person.UpdatePrimaryPhone behavior.
	- Review that each behavior in Person and Organization publishes an event.

*** Look into integrating unit of work into DB context?
- See OrderingContext for eShopOnContainers, which I noticed implements IUnitOfWork
- https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnContainers/blob/d2f7d6a5d6d9cc90caf9f7c6503bec459115c7af/src/Services/Ordering/Ordering.Infrastructure/OrderingContext.cs
- Maybe not good idea, violation of single responsibility? Or is it?

Event unit tests

Pass DomainErrorList up chain through common result
       - Add extension method for the conversion

Add RequestId to appropriate log messages
- See logging section in resources document

Rename RegisterLocalUser command to CreateLocalUser.

Add CreatedDate and ModifiedDate in AggregateRoot class.
- See article on shadow properties: http://www.talkingdotnet.com/use-shadow-properties-entity-framework-core/
- May not want to use those if users want to see the data.

Rename CommonResult to CommonResponse?

Add validation failure debug logging.

Add Forgot Password page Action - ForgotPassword.cshtml

Add Microsoft logger messages into Serilog context?

Fix default string values in CommonResult to string.Empty

Change "" in CommonResult constructors to string.Empty

- Fire "User logged in" event that contains the user?

Consider session IDs:
- Session correlation IDs in logging messages.
	- Inject with logger. Use session ID from cookie? See: 
		http://www.longest.io/2015/02/14/logging-correlation-ids-mvc.html
- Code location IDs in exceptions.

Obscure error handling:
- Add support contact info in configuration file, error view model and error view.

SPLIT IDENTITY DATABASE FROM MEMBERSHIP CONTEXT

Update formfield tag helper to properly handle passing-in of invalid field names.
