POTENTIAL CODE SMELLS

Identity and Login in the services/domain layers:
	- Is using a command to handle user login a bad idea? How much identity should really be in the
	services and domain layers? Is a reference to Domain.AppUser in the UI bad? 
	- SOLUTION: Since this is a monolithic application for the Membership bounded context and the
	UI layer it's OK for now. If the project gets refactored into separate solutions or
	microservices where the UI stands on its own and uses an API to communciate with the membership
	context then the removal of the login will come naturally.
