- Make a document called "Technical Debt".
  - Unit tests
  - Unbuild validators
  - Coupling of UI layer with rest of system

Add .Guard(obj, message) extension. See FluentValidation.Internal.Extensions

Consider adding "Internal" project for ... ?

Move on beyond CommandPreProcessors for a while.

Adding FluentValidation via pipeline

Rename RegisterLocalUser command to CreateLocalUser.

Rename CommonResult to CommonResponse?

Group commands/handlers into folders

Reformat complex return statements.

Fix ArgumentNullExceptions with literal string parameters.

Add Forgot Password page Action - ForgotPassword.cshtml

Add Microsoft logger messages into Serilog context.

Fix default string values in CommonResult to string.Empty

Finish Registration/Login
- NEED LOTS OF TESTING. I've somewhat lost track of where I was.
- Need logout page.
- Need to get default authorization login/out routes working, with proper parameters.

Change "" in CommonResult constructors to string.Empty.

Add Unit Tests as needed.

Add Fluent Validation of commands/queries.

Add validation to commonresult
- Require error message of some sort if not Status = Success

- Fire "User logged in" event that contains the user?

Consider correlation IDs:
- Session correlation IDs in logging messages.
	- Inject with logger. Use session ID from cookie? See: 
		http://www.longest.io/2015/02/14/logging-correlation-ids-mvc.html
- Code location IDs in exceptions.

Fix string manipulations in Serilog calls.

Next up: Accounts.
- Local registration and login.
- Azure AD OIDC registration and login.
- Azure AD claims persistence.
- MS Graph access test.

Resume: Account controller lines 257 and 261, replace with commands.

Obscure error handling:
- Add support contact info in configuration file, error view model and error view.
- Add message ID info in CommonResult and display as a correlation id with errors?

SPLIT IDENTITY DATABASE FROM MEMBERSHIP CONTEXT

Copy other documentation files from ObApp5.

Update formfield tag helper to properly handle passing-in of invalid field names.
