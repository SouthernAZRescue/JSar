VALIDATION

Simplify Client-Side Validation...By Adding a Server
	- Covers validation via MVC ActionFilter.
    - Geared toward an API, returns a JSON Model.
	- Should be adaptable to single-layer solution.
	- Also see Jimmy Bogard's ContosoUniversityCore example, it uses this method, but
	    I have yet to figure out what he is doing with the JSON object.
